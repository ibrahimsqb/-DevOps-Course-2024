# Technologies/Tools Learned
DevOps Tools and Concepts Learned
1. Docker:
A platform for creating, managing, and running containers. Containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent performance across environments.

2. Kubernetes:
An open-source container orchestration tool for automating deployment, scaling, and managing containerized applications across clusters of servers.

3. Ingress:
A Kubernetes component that manages external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services within a cluster, enabling routing rules, SSL termination, and load balancing.

4. Kyverno:
A Kubernetes-native policy engine that validates, mutates, and generates configurations, ensuring compliance and security within Kubernetes clusters.

5. Knative:
A Kubernetes-based platform that simplifies deploying and managing serverless workloads by automating scaling, event handling, and service deployment.

6. Prometheus:
An open-source system for monitoring and alerting, designed for collecting and querying metrics, particularly in cloud-native environments.

7. Grafana:
A visualization and analytics tool that integrates with multiple data sources (like Prometheus) to create customizable dashboards for real-time monitoring.

8. AWS (Amazon Web Services):
A comprehensive cloud platform offering scalable compute, storage, and other services, widely used for hosting, deploying, and scaling applications.

9. Istio:
A service mesh solution for Kubernetes that provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices, enhancing application networking.

Each of these tools plays a vital role in modern DevOps pipelines, enabling automation, monitoring, and efficient application management.

## [Blog 1: Simplifying Development with Containers: A General DevOps Workflow ](https://medium.com/@ibrahimsaqib20/simplifying-development-with-containers-a-general-devops-workflow-bcd0f5156c22)
This Blog Discusses:

Containerization packages applications with their dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments and eliminating the ‚Äúit works on my machine‚Äù problem. It accelerates development, simplifies onboarding, and enhances collaboration between developers and operations teams. Tools like Docker allow seamless deployment, scaling, and updates. For example, Spotify uses Docker to manage its microservices, enabling efficient scaling and independent updates of app components. Containerization is a game-changer for delivering reliable and scalable software efficiently.

Whether you‚Äôre part of a small team or a global organization like Spotify, containers are an essential tool for modern software development.

## [Blog 2: Integration of Keptn with Kubernetes to streamline and automate application lifecycle. ](https://medium.com/@ibrahimsaqib20/integration-of-keptn-with-kubernetes-to-streamline-and-automate-application-lifecycle-77d69b864643)
This Blog Discusses:

Keptn is an open-source platform that automates cloud-native application lifecycle tasks like deployment, monitoring, and performance testing. Built on GitOps and event-driven workflows, it integrates with tools like Jenkins, ArgoCD, and Prometheus while leveraging Kubernetes for scalability and workload management. 

### Key Features:
- Automates SRE tasks like quality gates and monitoring.
- Offers a CLI and a web interface for workflow management.
- Seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes clusters for streamlined DevOps operations.

Keptn simplifies application lifecycle management, reducing manual effort and improving system reliability. 

## [Blog 3: Transforming a Sample Repository with DevOps Tooling: A Hands-On Guide ](https://medium.com/@ibrahimsaqib20/transforming-a-sample-repository-with-devops-tooling-a-hands-on-guide-cc3168fc63c2)
This Blog Discusses:

This guide explores how to transform a public repository into a production-ready application using DevOps tools and practices.

### Steps:
1. **Select a Repository**: Start with a Node.js web app (e.g., `hackathon-starter`) and clone it locally.
2. **Version Control**: Use Git to track changes and create a new branch for DevOps tooling.
3. **Implement CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deploying to platforms like Netlify.
4. **Containerize with Docker**: Create a Dockerfile for consistent environment setup across systems.
5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
6. **Monitoring**: Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and dashboards.
7. **Security Scans**: Use Snyk to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

Transform your project into a scalable, secure, and observable system leveraging these modern DevOps practices! üöÄ
